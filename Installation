Download the static binary archive. Go to https://download.docker.com/linux/static/stable/ (or change stable to nightly or test), choose your hardware platform, and download the .tgz file relating to the version of Docker CE you want to install.

Extract the archive using the tar utility. The dockerd and docker binaries are extracted.

$ tar xzvf /path/to/<FILE>.tar.gz
Optional: Move the binaries to a directory on your executable path, such as /usr/bin/. If you skip this step, you must provide the path to the executable when you invoke docker or dockerd commands.

$ sudo cp docker/* /usr/bin/
Start the Docker daemon:

$ sudo dockerd &
If you need to start the daemon with additional options, modify the above command accordingly or create and edit the file /etc/docker/daemon.json to add the custom configuration options.

Verify that Docker is installed correctly by running the hello-world image.

$ sudo docker run hello-world
